Project 1 - QR decoder server and client C applications
Authors: Gibson Phillips and Seth Frank

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAMPLE COMMANDS
	These are the recommended commands you can copy and paste in to get things working. Please use these as reference. 
gcc server.c
./a.out <listening-port> <rate-limit> <max-users> <time-limit>
./a.out 2012 3 3 80

gcc client.c
./a.out <server-ip-address> <listening-port>
./a.out "Your server's ip address" 2012

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SETUP
The server.c file needs to be compiled with gcc on a virtual machine(VM) and run with the parameters of [port-number] [rate-limit] [Max-Users] and [Time-out]
The client.c file should also be compiled and run in a different VM with the parameters of [server-ip-address] and [port-number]
You should make sure that the server-ip-address option matches the address to the current system running the server.c application. 
IP addresses can be found with the command "ifconfig"
Please also make sure that the port numbers are the same, otherwise the client and server apps won't be able to find eachother. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE
Once the client connects to the server, you are prompted for the name of a png file. 
The PNG file must be in the directory you are in before you run the client-side app. 
We have included a png of a qr code, but you are welcome to try your own. The one provided in the project checkpoint should also work. 

As the prompt will also explain, send "close" to close your connection to the server, and "disconnect" to shut down the connection and the server as a whole.
